// rule below names the dependent questions by that number:
//
//   "What is the type of the ownership?"
//     Leasehold         -> questions 10 and 11
//     Shared Ownership  -> question 9
//     anything else     -> none of 9, 10, 11
//
// Hidden questions are left out of the section entirely: navigation,
// "Question N of M", the progress bar, "remaining" and the completion check
// all run on the visible list (see usePassportRuntime).
