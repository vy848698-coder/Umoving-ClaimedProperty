// A small, NON-secret flag cookie — not the JWT itself, and never read or
// trusted by the backend API. Its only job is letting the Nuxt SERVER know
// "this browser probably has a session" before it renders anything, so
// middleware/guest.ts can redirect an already-signed-in visitor server-side
// instead of flashing the marketing landing page and only then discovering
// the token in localStorage after hydration.
//
// Worst case if this is stale or forged: the server guesses the wrong page to
// render first. It grants no privilege — every real page and API call is
// still gated by the actual JWT in localStorage, sent as an Authorization
// header. This cookie is purely a routing hint.
//
// Plain document.cookie rather than Nuxt's useCookie() is deliberate: these
// setters get called from places that aren't inside a fresh Nuxt composable
// context (e.g. a `finally` block after an `await`), where useCookie() can
// throw. The reading side (middleware/guest.ts) uses useCookie(), which is
// exactly where Nuxt expects it and is what makes the cookie visible to SSR.
//
// Name is app-specific (not just "umu_has_session") because cookies are
// scoped by HOST only, not by port - on localhost, umu-mobile-webapp (3003)
// and umu-website-new (3001) see this exact same cookie jar as this app
// (3000). A shared name meant logging into one app set a flag the others'
// guest.ts read as "already signed in" and bounced to /dashboard, which
// then broke because that app's own JWT (a separate, per-origin
// localStorage entry) was never actually set (client report, 12 Oct 2026).
